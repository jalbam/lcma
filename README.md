Description

Open source card game made with PHP, HTML and a little bit of CSS.

It is in Spanish language and will work in any web browser, even without CSS support.

The game is minimalist and it doesn't use any image at all but only text created with pure HTML and tables. So you will be able to play it in a text-based browser too, such as Links and Lynx.

This cross-platform and cross-browser game has been tested under BeOS, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Windows, Mac OS X, QNX, BlackBerry Tablet OS, Android, iOS and others.
